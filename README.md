# ZRAM-SWAP-Optimizer
This module have been built mostly for phones used for gaming, especially for Pok√©mon Go.
It works on most devices, and can help with certain systems being aggresive when it comes to killing running apps due to memory.


## ZRAM (SWAP) Optimizer Magisk Module
A lightweight Android script that enhances performance by:
* Automatic ZRAM Sizing, Detects device RAM and sets ZRAM size dynamically. 
* Optimizes compression (uses fast lz4 by default)
* Tunes VM settings for better memory management
   * Periodic VM Tuning:
   * Reapplies VM settings every 5 minutes to prevent system overrides.
* Auto-fallback to swap file if ZRAM fails
* Clean logging with device info (Log file can be found in /sdcard/zram_optimizer.log)

## Requirements
Your phone needs to be rooted in order to use this module.
Confirmed working on:
* Magisk
* Kitsune
* Apatch
* KSU

## How to install
1. Download the latest release
2. Open root manager (Magisk, Magisk Alpha, Kitsune, APatch or KernelSU)
3. Go to `Modules`
4. Tap `Install from storage`
5. Select the .zip file you just downloaded
6. Reboot device as required
**Like always there is a risk of this module bootlooping the phone.**
